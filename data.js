		name: `Giant TCR Advanced SL 0`,
		data: `Giant’s premier race bike gets a full redesign for model year 2021. The frame is 140 grams lighter, which helps keep the top-of-the-line model shown here at just 14.5 pounds (size large)—impressive for a bike with a power meter, disc brakes, and 42mm-deep tubeless-ready wheels. And even though this version weighs less, Giant added some aerodynamic tuning to reduce drag for greater efficiency. The new TCR embraces the trend toward wider tires with clearance for up to 32mm-wide rubber. The build reflects the price: SRAM Red eTap AXS with power meter, carbon bar and stem, and a Cadex (a Giant brand) wheelset with carbon rims and carbon spokes. On the road, this bike is very quick and handles extremely well.`

	{
		name: `Specialized S-Works Aethos`,
		data: `The latest road bike from Specialized is just that: a road bike. A traditional road bike void of fancy tube shapes and handlebar configurations—and any other design element that doesn’t substantively add to the quality of the ride. Aimed at riders who want race bike performance but are disenchanted with modern aero bikes and the corresponding headaches that come with the proprietary parts, the Aethos matches the much-vaunted Tarmac SL7 in stiffness and handling, and it’s several pounds lighter. Our 58cm test bike tipped the scales just over 14 pounds. The Aethos is also much more user-friendly than the SL7: Gone are the aero and integrated handlebar, proprietary seatpost, and fully internal brake-hose routing. In its place you’ll find a round, 27.2mm-diameter seatpost, a standard stem with a round handlebar, and a threaded BSA bottom bracket. Although the S-Works model costs as much as a compact car, cheaper models are readily available.`

		name: `Canyon Ultimate CF EVO Disc 10.0 LTD`,
		data: `The Evo is based on the existing Ultimate CF Disc. It shares the same mold but uses a different blend of carbon fiber to cut weight; a medium frame is claimed to weigh just 641 grams. Canyon tops it off with a svelte build kit based around SRAM’s Red eTap AXS groupset to create a bike that weighs in at a jaw-dropping 13 pounds in our size small test sample. Buyer beware: There is little compromise in the bike. Geometry is race-oriented and designed for a fit rider who likes quick handling; ride quality doesn’t quite match up to that of the best all-around race machines like the Specialized Tarmac; and the narrow focus on light weight means some of the parts picks are finicky and unforgiving. But if you want to hammer, especially on hills, the bike just…works. If you can afford it and can put up with its fussiness, it’s a devastatingly effective hill-climbing machine that does not beg to be ridden fast; it demands it.`

	{
		name: `Pinarello`,
		data: `The Dogma F12 puts on no pretenses; one look at it and you know that Pinarello designed the bike to be fast, smooth, and balanced. The unbelievably skinny frame, aero wheels, and aggressive geometry made jaws drop all over our office. The brand’s fastest, lightest, and stiffest frame yet, the F12 has better lateral stiffness at the bottom bracket than its predecessor, the F10. This is thanks to an advance in technology from its carbon manufacturer that allows Pinarello to use less material while still achieving the same strength. The raw, unpainted F12 frame weighs a claimed 840 grams—that’s 1.8 pounds. Pinarello also beefed up a few areas of the frame while allowing for more flexion in others by making them thinner to make the power transfer as efficient as possible. This is one freaky-fast bike, which it better be given the price tag.`

	{
		name: `Specialized Tarmac SL7 Pro`,
		data: `The Tarmac Disc Pro delivers the same highly refined ride characteristics of the $11,000 S-Works Tarmac, but at a much more affordable price. The Tarmac Disc Pro, however, is every bit a high-performance bike. It’s stiff but not overly harsh, tracks beautifully through hard turns without feeling twitchy, aero enough for Peter Sagan to win Grand Tour stages, and light enough to take into the mountains. It doesn’t have the same level of vertical compliance that some high-end carbon bikes offer, but it has just enough to take the edge off. Instead of a silky-smooth ride, you experience enough of the road that you feel very in tune to what’s happening below your wheels. The Tarmac Disc Pro offers up one of the most refined riding experiences you’ll find anywhere—stiff but not harsh, agile but not twitchy, and aero without being heavy.`

	{
		name: `Cannondale CAAD 13 Disc 105`,
		data: `We’ve loved Cannondale’s aluminum frames because they offer outstanding performance for a reasonable price. Cannondale carries that legacy forward with the faster and more refined CAAD 13. The latest CAAD has some aerodynamic tuning to save watts, clearance for 30mm tires (disc models), and shares geometry with Cannondale’s SuperSix carbon race bike. It’s not all business—the new CAAD has hidden fender mounts too.`
	},
	{
		name: `Canyon Aeroad CF SL 7 Disc`,
		data: `This might be the best value in road racing bikes. For about $4,000, this Aeroad offers an aerodynamically optimized carbon frame that’s silly fast, with 58mm-deep carbon wheels, and a slick-shifting Shimano 105 drivetrain. We tested the most expensive model, the $9,000 Aeroad CFR, and although the CF SL 76 uses a heavier carbon, it still boasts the same crazy fast aero frame and sharp, precise handling as its more expensive sibling.`
	},
	{
		name: `Wilier Zero SLR`,
		data: `Wilier-Triestina’s Zero SLR is extremely light and devastatingly fast. It’s a shining example of how great a modern high-end road racing bike can be. Designed for disc brakes and electronic-shift drivetrain only, the ZSLR has a claimed 780-gram frame that features aerodynamic tuning and a layer of liquid crystal polymer in the carbon to improve toughness and damp vibrations. The ride is glassy smooth, with all the stiffness you’d want for efficient climbing, with velvety handling that’s a little less hyperactive than the typical race bike.`
	},
	{
		name: `Trek Domane SLR 7`,
		data: `Trek’s new Domane SLR is one of the best road bikes you can buy. It’s a perfect blend of performance, practicality, and versatility like we’ve never experienced. It’s crisp, slippery, and sharp handling like a road racing bike. But with Trek’s decouplers—which greatly increase vertical compliance compared to a rigid frame—front and rear, the ride is practically plush, soaking up bumps big and small without (and this is important) killing the bike’s feedback. Hidden storage in the down tube lets you carry tools, a flat kit, and more without hanging junky-looking bags all over the sleek frame. Plus it has massive tire clearance—up to 38mm—and hidden fender mounts.`
